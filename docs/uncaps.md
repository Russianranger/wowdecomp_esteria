# Implementation Plan: Uncapping the Quest Log, Classes, and Bag Sizes

Status: draft
Target: WoW 3.3.5a client (build 12340) as reconstructed in this repo, x64 primary / Win32 for layout checks
Companion to: `README.md` (build instructions, `WOWDECOMP_DISABLE_SIGNATURE_CHECKS`)

---

## 0. Goals and ground rules

| # | Goal | Target | Client-only? |
|---|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Active quests | thousands | No — requires server + new transport (see §4) |
| 2 | Classes | > 10, up to 32 (then protocol wall) | Mostly yes (data + small fixes) |
| 3 | Bag size | up to 255 slots without protocol change; ~630 with field work | Client changes + matching server |

Verdict summary (from the survey): **classes are easy** (data + three out-of-bounds fixes),
**bag size is a systematic medium** (a set of self-consistent resize edits, no protocol change
below 256 slots), and **the quest log is a project** (player-object wire budget is
~99% full at the stock layout; thousands of quests cannot travel in update fields).

### Ground rules

1. **Fidelity first.** This repository's value is that every function maps to an original
   address. All layout-changing work (bags with a size other than 36, quest log with a size
   other than 25, update-mask widening) must be gated behind CMake options that default to the
   original 12340 layout. Default builds must stay byte-for-byte comparable (`re/tools/verify.py`,
   Win32 struct checks).
2. **Server agreement.** Every wire-layout change needs the server to emit the matching layout.
   This document lists the server requirements per workstream; the server itself is out of tree.
3. **UI lives in MPQs.** `ContainerFrame.lua`, `QuestLogFrame.lua`, `CharacterCreate.lua`, etc.
   are not in this repo. UI work is listed per workstream and ships via a patch MPQ; for local
   testing, build with `-DWOWDECOMP_DISABLE_SIGNATURE_CHECKS=ON`.
4. **Order of work.** Classes first (cheap, isolated), bags second (bounded), quest log last
   (depends on infrastructure built for the other two, and is the only one needing new opcodes).

### Proposed CMake options

```cmake
# docs/uncaps.md: they change struct layouts and descriptor tables away from 12340.
option(WOWDECOMP_EXTENDED_LIMITS "Enable layout-changing extended limits" OFF)
set(WOWDECOMP_CONTAINER_SLOTS 36  CACHE STRING "WOWGUID slots per container item (36 = 12340)")
set(WOWDECOMP_QUEST_LOG_SLOTS 25  CACHE STRING "PLAYER_QUEST_LOG slots (25 = 12340)")
set(WOWDECOMP_MAX_UPDATE_MASKS 42 CACHE STRING "max update-mask dwords (42 = stock client cap)")
```

`WOWDECOMP_EXTENDED_LIMITS=ON` turns on the layout-dependent code paths; with the defaults the
tree compiles to the stock layout even when the option is on. The class workstream needs **no**
option: its fixes are bounds hardening plus DBC data and are safe for stock builds.

---

## 1. Shared subsystem background (read before touching anything)

All player/container state that the server sends flows through **object update fields**:

```
SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT
  └─ (per object) uint8 blockCount            ← hard wire width: 1 byte
     blockCount × uint32 masks                ← bit i of mask b = dword (b*32+i) present
     present dwords only                       (sparse)
       └─ ObjectMgrClient copies dwords into CGObjectData/CGItemData/... storage
          → mirror system re-runs registered handlers for changed fields
```

Key facts and constants (all verified against this tree):

| Concept | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Player dwords (active player) | **1326** | `WoW/Source/ObjectMgrClient/ObjectMgrClient.cpp:58`, `:479` |
| Player dwords (other players) | 324 | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:479` |
| Max mask dwords accepted by client | **42 × 32 = 1344** | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:507` (`if (count > 42) return 0;`), `masks[42]` at `:527`, `:915`, `:980` |
| Quest log block | 25 slots × 5 dwords (20 B/slot), data dwords 10..134 | `Mirror.cpp:167-266`, `Player.h:60` (`PlayerQuestLogEntry m_playerQuestLog[25]`) |
| Daily quest block | 25 dwords | `Mirror.cpp:366`, `Player.h:124` |
| Container block | `6 + 58 + 2 + 2×N` dwords (N=36 → 138) | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:58`, `:466-472`, `Mirror.cpp:57-61`, `Container.h:26` |
| Descriptor tables (fixed arrays) | `PLAYER_DESCRIPTORS[215]`, `CONTAINER_DESCRIPTORS[3]` | `Mirror.h:23-30`, `Mirror.cpp:57`, `:157` |
| Expanded descriptor tables | sized from `sizeof(...)` — auto-grow | `Mirror.h:31-38` |
| Mirror-handler global table | `TSList[...] s_typeMirrorHandlers[TYPES][1326]` | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:43` |
| Per-object mirror lists | player 176 + 1002, container 74, item 58 | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:1032-1047` |
| Mirror index maps | `CGPlayer::s_mirrorFields[173]`, `s_localMirrorFields[870]`, fallback `1178` | `Player.cpp:5-104` |
| Field totals | `CGPlayer::TotalFields() = CGUnit::TotalFields() + 1043` | `Player.cpp:132-134` |

**Budget picture (active player):** 1326 of 1344 addressable dwords are used. 18 dwords free ≈
3 more quest slots **or** 9 GUID fields, not both. Everything larger must widen the mask cap
(the `blockCount` byte allows up to 255 masks = 8160 dwords) or leave update fields entirely.

**Implication for this plan:** there is a usable engineering ladder —
no-change ≤ 1344 dwords → mask-widened ≤ 8160 dwords → custom packets for unbounded.

### Infrastructure task I-1: descriptor table generator

The three fixed tables (`PLAYER_DESCRIPTORS`, `CONTAINER_DESCRIPTORS`, and the mirror index maps
in `Player.cpp`/`Container.cpp`) are hand-written expansions of arithmetic patterns. Resizing
them by hand is how this project gets corrupted field offsets. **Write a small generator**
(`Tools/gen_descriptors.py`, checked in, output pasted or `#include`d) that takes
`(questSlots, dailySlots, containerSlots)` and emits:

- `PLAYER_DESCRIPTORS` rows with all offsets recomputed (`Mirror.cpp`)
- `CONTAINER_DESCRIPTORS` count field (`Mirror.cpp`)
- `CGPlayer::s_mirrorFields` / `s_localMirrorFields` and the fallback index (`Player.cpp`)
- the quest-log handler range `0x28 .. 0x28 + 20*questSlots` (`Player_C.cpp:7199`)
- the daily-quest handler range and `s_objDwordCount`/`GetNumDwordBlocks` numbers
- the hardcoded byte ranges in `Player_C.cpp:7183-7197` and `ContainerFrame.cpp:29-47`, `:92-110`

This is the single highest-leverage piece of the whole plan; budget it first (2-4 days).

---

## 2. Workstream C — Classes (do this first)

**Target: class IDs 12..32 (up to 20 new classes).** 3.3.5a uses ids 1–9 and 11 (10 is free);
Druid = 11 (`NamePlateFrame.cpp:43-53` colors, `Tooltip.cpp` feral-AP checks). Class is stored as
a full byte in `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0[1]` (`Unit.h:62`); nothing packs it into 4 bits. Most paths
iterate `ChrClasses.dbc`/`CharBaseInfo.dbc` dynamically, and the fork already extends races this
way (`CharacterCreation.h:18` `MAX_RACES = 129`), so classes can follow the same pattern.

### C-1 Required fixes (hard out-of-bounds today)

| Site | Problem | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `WoW/Source/Ui/NamePlateFrame.cpp:43` | `s_classColors[12]` hits class 12 OOB (used at `:362`) | Extend to `[33]` (or drive from `ChrClasses` colors if the DBC carries them in your pipeline); add `classId < ARRAY_SIZE` guard |
| `WoW/Source/Ui/CGLookingForGroup.cpp:28` | `s_classRoles[11]`, `GetClassRoles()` at `:38-40` has no bounds check | Extend table, add bounds check; new classes need a role byte (roles are per-class data, not derivable) |
| `WoW/Source/Glue/CharacterCreation.cpp:398` | `int32_t classes[10]` overflows on the 11th class for a race (`GetRandomClassID`) | Make dynamic (`TSStackArray`) or `[MAX_CLASSES]`; fix the `count <= 0` path at `:410-412` which returns `classes[0]` uninitialized |
| `WoW/Source/Glue/CharacterCreation_Scripts.cpp:533-535` | `Script_SetSelectedClass` dereferences `classRec` unchecked | Add null check (hardening, independent of uncap) |

### C-2 Data requirements (no client code change)

- `ChrClasses.dbc`: one row per new class (60 columns — column count is asserted at load,
  `WowClientDB.h:133-145`; **add rows only, never columns**). `m_spellClassSet` at
  `ChrClassesRec.h:23` must be unique per class; the spell-modifier pool is 3×32 bits shared
  across all classes (`Spell_C.cpp:1258-1292`, `SpellRec.h:101`).
- `CharBaseInfo.dbc`: race/class pairs (bytes; supports 12–255).
- `CharStartOutfit.dbc`, `SkillLineAbility.dbc`, `SkillRaceClassInfo.dbc`, talent `TalentTab.dbc`
  + `Talent.dbc`, and the `gt*` game tables (`gtChanceToMeleeCrit*`, `gtChanceToSpellCrit*`,
  `gtOCTClassCombatRatingScalar`, mana/health regen) — all extend by **rows**; the `gt` tables are
  addressed as `column + row * numRows` with class as the row (`tables.cpp:39-76`,
  `Player_C.cpp:10710-10718`, `Unit_C.cpp:17466-17475`, `:21147-21218`), so per-class columns are
  already the pattern.
- Class-specific visual/audio branches that are hardcoded by id (DK 6, Hunter 3, Rogue 4,
  Druid 11, etc.) do not need changes for new classes to function — they just fall through to
  defaults. Audit list (from survey): `Unit_C.cpp:19017, 19146, 21165`; `Player_C.cpp:8227,
  13787`; `ScriptEvents_Scripts.cpp:2890`; `SpellBookFrame.cpp:814`; `LCD.cpp:308-344`;
  `ComponentUtils.cpp:42-55`; `CharacterCreation.cpp:437, 500`; `CGlueMgr.cpp:397-407`.

### C-3 The 32-bit class-mask audit (this defines the ceiling)

All masks are 32-bit; class N uses bit N‑1 in most, bit N in two places. Practical ceiling:
**class ≤ 31 for full compatibility, ≤ 32 for everything except the who-list.**

| System | Site | Bit convention | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spell/skill lookups | `SpellTable.cpp:52-61`, `:105` | class−1 | 32 |
| Talent tabs | `TalentInfo.cpp:391, 394, 425, 428` | class−1 | 32 |
| Faction reputation | `ReputationInfo.cpp:367-386`; `Tooltip.cpp:2022` | class−1 (mask is `int32_t[4]` but only one element is ever used) | 32 now, 128 with code change |
| Item `allowableClass` | `ItemStats.h:22` (wire u32) | class−1 | 32 (protocol) |
| Who-list filter | `FriendList.cpp:603, 698, 771, 887` | **class ID** (not −1) | **31** (`1 << 32` is UB) |
| Minimap tracking | `MinimapFrame.h:131`, `MinimapFrame.cpp:175-191, 676-694` | class ID | 31 |
| Realm race/class restrictions | `CharacterSelection_Scripts.cpp:59-104`, `RealmConnection.h:61-70` (u32 masks) | class ID | 31 |
| Appearance system | `WoW/Common/ComponentCore/VulperaAppearance.h:283-295` | class−1, explicit `classId > 32` guard | 32 |

Recommendation: **target 32 classes max** (ids up to 32), with the who-list/tracking filters
silently excluding class 32 until those two masks are widened. Going past 32 means widening the
item `allowableClass` wire field, `CMSG_WHO`, `TalentTab.dbc`/skill DBC columns, and the realm
restriction packet — a separate, protocol-level project; out of scope here.

### C-4 UI

`CharacterCreate.lua` drives class selection from `GetAvailableClasses()` /
`GetClassesForRace()` (`CharacterCreation_Scripts.cpp:210-232, 482-504`) — data-driven, but the
class list layout and icons (if any) need checking for >12 entries. `Script_FillLocalizedClassList`
(`ScriptEvents_Scripts.cpp:630-650`) is also data-driven.

### C-5 Tests / definition of done

- Create every new class; enter world; nameplate + unit frame colors; `UnitClass()` strings.
- Open talents (`TalentInfo`), trainer, spellbook; verify no other class's spells leak in
  (spellClassSet uniqueness).
- LFG role assignment for a new class; who-list filter includes/excludes correctly.
- Equip class-restricted item tests at the boundary (class 32 items behave as restricted).
- Character select/glue screens; DK-style special-case paths do not mis-trigger (they check
  exact ids).
- Stock build still byte-verifiable (no layout changes).

**Effort: 1 day of client code + N days of data/content. Risk: low.**

## 3. Workstream B — Bag sizes

**Target options:**

| Target | Feasibility | Protocol change? |
|---|---|---|
| 37..128 slots | straightforward (recommended first target: **128**) | none |
| 129..254 | same edits, more testing | none |
| 255 | slot value 255 collides with the "no bag" sentinel (`FindSlotIndex` returns `0xFF`) — **do not ship 255**, cap at 254 or fix sentinels | none, but risky |
| 256..630 | mask-widening + uint16 slot protocol + server + UI | yes (`CMSG_*` slot bytes) |
| >630 | new inventory transport | redesign |

The ceiling derives from: container dwords `= 66 + 2N ≤ 1326` (global handler table
`s_typeMirrorHandlers[...][1326]`, `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:43`) → **N ≤ 630**, with the mask cap
42×32=1344 giving a similar bound; both need the mask/constant work for anything above ~600.
For N ≤ 254 everything stays inside existing widths.

### B-1 Layout edits (all self-consistent; formula: `2 + 2N` container dwords)

| Site | Current | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `WoW/Source/Object/Container.h:26` | `WOWGUID m_containerFieldSlot1[36]` | `[WOWDECOMP_CONTAINER_SLOTS]` |
| `Container.h:12` + `Container.cpp` | `s_mirrorFields[72]`, fallback 74, `TotalFieldsSaved() + 72` | `2N`, `2+2N` per generator (I-1) |
| `ObjectMgrClient/Mirror.cpp:57-61` | `CONTAINER_FIELD_SLOT_1, 2, 72, 4` | `2N` |
| `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:58` | `0x8A` (138) | `66 + 2N` |
| `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:466-472` | `return 138` | same constant |
| `ObjectClient/Container_C.h:14` | `m_containerMirrorLists[74]` | `2 + 2N` |
| `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:1032` | `FreeMirrorHandlers(..., 74)` | `2 + 2N` |
| `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:100-102` | container field base `0x100` | unchanged (object+item sizes unchanged) |

`SetupObjectStorage` (`ObjectMgrClient.cpp:710-715`) and `s_objTotalSize`
(`ObjectMgrClient.cpp:61-70`) derive from `sizeof(...)` and need no edit once the struct grows.
The expanded descriptor arrays (`Mirror.h:33`) also auto-size. That is the whole storage
change — the system is consistent by design, which is why this is medium-honest work and not
hacky.

### B-2 Safety

- **Clamp the server value.** `Container_C.cpp:7-8` trusts `m_containerFieldNumSlots` and points
  `m_bag.m_slots` into the array with no clamp; a hostile/buggy server sending > N reads OOB.
  Clamp to `WOWDECOMP_CONTAINER_SLOTS` (and log once).
- **No guard changes needed for N ≤ 255**: the `srcSlot > 255` fatal guards
  (`Player_C.cpp:9925, 10007, 10113`) and uint8 wire writes stay valid.
- If N > 255 ever happens: `FindSlotIndex`/`FindItemSlot` use `uint8_t` loop counters
  (`Player_C.cpp:1611, 9858`) — they wrap into an infinite loop past 255; all `msg.Put((uint8_t)slot)`
  sites in `Player_C.cpp` (~15 CMSG builders) need widening, plus the server. Tracked here for
  completeness; recommend staying ≤ 254.

### B-3 Performance note

`ContainerFrame.cpp:85-89` registers one mirror handler per slot on open and unregisters on close
(2 lists per dword per bag). At N=128 this is ~128 handlers per bag — acceptable; at 600+, consider
a single whole-range handler plus manual diff, or lazy per-slot registration.

### B-4 UI + data

- Patch MPQ: `ContainerFrame.lua/.xml` grid (stock UI is built for small bags; validate row/column
  generation at the target size and extend if the grid hardcodes 4 rows). `GetContainerNumSlots`
  (`ContainerFrame_Scripts.cpp:114-142`) already returns the container's real `m_numSlots` for bag
  indices ≥ 0 — no client change; only the fixed values 16/28/32 for backpack/bank/keyring are
  literals (see appendix).
- Item tooltips print `stats->m_containerSlots` (`Tooltip.cpp:4423-4428`) from the client item
  cache — no cap; server item templates must set `ContainerSlots` to ≤ N.
- Item creation path: server defines actual slot count in the container update block; client
  follows.

### B-5 Backpack/bank (hard, deliberately descoped)

Growing `m_playerFieldPackSlot1[16]` / `BankSlot1[28]` (`Player.h:69-75`) in place is blocked by
the 18-dword player headroom and shifts the entire player field layout. If bigger backpack/bank is
ever wanted, the sane route is a **virtual container**: server supplies an extra equipable bag slot
(or two) hosting the extra space as a real `CGContainer` — no player-layout change at all. The
2024-era field arrays stay untouched. (Also note bank-bag purchases are capped at 7 in
`CGBankInfo_Scripts.cpp:94-99` and `ContainerFrame.h:13` `m_containers[11]`; extending those is
mechanical if needed.)

### B-6 Tests / definition of done

- Buy/equip a bag of the target size; open, swap slot 0 ↔ slot N−1, split to last slot,
  auto-store into last free slot, sort, vendor sell from last slot, mail-attach from last slot,
  trade from last slot, guild bank deposit, bank bag, loot to bag.
- Full-bag states: autostore returns "inventory full" correctly.
- Logout/login with items in high slots; bag persists.
- Two oversized bags open simultaneously; bank + bags open.
- Server sending a bad count is clamped, not crashing.
- Stock build unchanged.

**Effort: 2-4 days client edits + 2-5 days UI/testing. Risk: medium (systematic, wide).**

---

## 4. Workstream A — Quest log (the hard one)

**Why it is hard:** the client's own quest log is 25 update-field slots inside a player object
that already uses 1326 of the 1344 addressable dwords. "Thousands of active quests" cannot be
expressed as quest-log fields at all; even mask-widening tops out around ~1,390 slots. The
durable answer is a dedicated quest-log packet pair with the update-field log kept (or dropped)
as legacy.

### Milestones (each independently useful; each needs the matching server)

#### M1 — 28-slots rehearsal (no protocol change, stock server works if it sends ≤28)

Exactly the 3 extra slots the mask budget allows (1326 + 3×5 = 1341 ≤ 1344).

Resize points (the full list is the template for M2/M3):

| Area | Sites |
|---|---|
| Storage | `Player.h:60` `m_playerQuestLog[25]` (20 B/slot, 5 dwords) |
| Descriptor table | `Mirror.cpp:167-266` (100 rows), `Mirror.h:27` `PLAYER_DESCRIPTORS[215]` |
| Field maps | `Player.cpp:5-17` (`s_mirrorFields`), `:20-76` (`s_localMirrorFields`), `:103` fallback `1178`, `:133` `+1043` |
| Handler ranges | `Player_C.cpp:7199-7201` (`0x28 < 0x21C`), `ScriptEvents.cpp:392, 407` (`0x28, 0x1F4`) |
| Block counts | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:58` `0x52E`, `:479` `1326`/`324` |
| Mirror lists | `Player_C.cpp:7182+` registration loops, `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:1043-1046` counts |
| Slot checks | ~15 sites using `<= 25` / `> 25` (off-by-ones) — `Player_C.cpp:3802, 7128, 12511`; `QuestLog.cpp:326, 403, 1081, 1316, 1369, 1640, 2135`; `QuestLog_Scripts.cpp:273, 929, 1112, 1142, 1474`; `GameObject_C.cpp:3813` |
| Client quest arrays | `QuestLog.h:89/113/114/124` + `QuestLog.cpp:42/72/75/96` (`m_sortTypes`, `m_quests[50]=2×25`, `m_questWatches`, `m_questPOIs`) |
| Removal | `CGPlayer_C::QuestLogRemoveQuest(uint8_t)` `Player_C.cpp:1866`, caller `QuestLog.cpp:452` (fine at ≤255) |

Fix the off-by-ones to `>= N` when touching (`slot <= 25` is an OOB read at slot 25 today).

#### M2 — up to ~1,390 slots via update-mask widening (custom server required)

Wire format already supports it: `blockCount` is a single byte, so up to 255 masks = 8160 dwords.

| Change | Sites |
|---|---|
| Mask arrays 42 → `WOWDECOMP_MAX_UPDATE_MASKS` (255) | `ObjectMgrClient.cpp:507, 517-518, 527, 915, 980` |
| Player block counts | `GetNumDwordBlocks` `:479`, `s_objDwordCount[ID_PLAYER]` `:58`, non-active 324 |
| Global handler table | `s_typeMirrorHandlers[...][1326]` `:43` → max managed section length |
| Descriptor regeneration | generator I-1 (all of M1's table, sized N) + `PLAYER_DESCRIPTORS` extern size |
| Funds | player field budget check: `1326 + 5(N−25) ≤ 255×32` → **N ≤ 1392**; also daily quests + POI/watch arrays |
| Server | must emit sparse masks with > 42 blocks for the player object only when needed; DB quest slots widen from uint8 (e.g., 300 stored quests/slot table) |

Sparse masks matter: only the highest changed block extends the mask, so a 300-slot log costs
~47 mask dwords while only a few fields change. Still, at 1000+ slots the block count per update
and the per-update allocation grow; test with the update rate in mind.

#### M3 — thousands: dedicated quest-log transport (the real answer)

Design sketch (client is already questId-centric — `CGQuestLog::GetQuestIndex`,
`GetQuestLogSlot`, `IsOnQuest` key on questId, so the "slot" is mostly a server/UI artifact):

- Keep the legacy 25 `PLAYER_QUEST_LOG` fields untouched (or stop writing them) so stock paths
  and other subsystems keep working; the extended log lives in a new structure:
  `TSGrowableArray<QuestLogEntryEx>` + `questId → index` hash, owned by `CGQuestLog`.
- New opcodes (pick unallocated values in your server's table; 3.3.5 opcode space extends well
  past `0x400` — see `Net/Types.h:1032`):
  - `SMSG_QUEST_LOG_SYNC_HEADER {u32 totalCount, u32 chunkStart, u8 moreChunks}`
  - `SMSG_QUEST_LOG_SYNC_CHUNK {entries...}` — entry = `{u32 questId, u32 state, u16 count[4],
    u32 time, u8 flags}` (~23 B; chunk to ≤ 4 KB)
  - `SMSG_QUEST_LOG_ADD/DELTA {entry}` and `SMSG_QUEST_LOG_REMOVE {u32 questId}`
  - `CMSG_QUEST_LOG_REMOVE_QUEST32 {u32 questId}` (replaces the uint8-slot opcode for the
    extended range)
- Client integration points: `CGQuestLog::Update/FilterAndSortQuests` read from the new table;
  `m_quests[50]` becomes dynamic; watches (`m_questWatches[25]`) and POIs (`m_questPOIs[25]`)
  become growable and are fed by the same sync; `m_questWatche`s/POI handler loops
  (`QuestLog.cpp:150-161`, `:2108`) stop using literal 25.
- Keep `CMSG_QUEST_QUERY` per quest as-is (details already queried lazily and cached).
- Quest-giver lists: arrays are 32-deep (`Player_C.cpp:309-321`, `titles[32][512]` at `:7454`,
  parse loop `:7456-7475` **without a clamp**; `GossipInfo.h:37/43`; `QuestFrame.h` 32-deep
  arrays) — clamp now; grow to the desired NPC offer limit regardless of milestone.
- Daily quests: `PLAYER_FIELD_DAILY_QUESTS_1` 25 (`Mirror.cpp:366`), completed-count handlers
  `0x11B0..0x1214` (`Player_C.cpp:7203-7205`), `ReportDailyQuestsRemaining` (`:12205-12221`),
  `GetMaxDailyQuests` returns literal 25 (`QuestFrame_Scripts.cpp:135`) — move the counter into
  the new sync under M3, or grow descriptors under M2.
- Collapse-filter CVar is a 32-bit mask (`GameUI_CVar.cpp:493-494`, `1 << sortId` in
  `QuestLog.cpp:866-867`) — with thousands of quests, header groups can exceed 31; replace with
  a growable set when it matters.

**UI (all milestones; M3 mandatory):** `QuestLogFrame.lua` is a fixed-row faux-scroll list tuned
for 25 entries. Replace with a virtualized list (recycle ~12 visible rows, scroll over N).
Sorting/filtering and the detail pane read via `GetQuestLogTitle(index)` /
`SelectQuestLogEntry(index)` — 1-based Lua numbers, no width issues, but the C++ side must stop
deriving array positions from 25-slot assumptions.

**Server requirements (out of tree):**

- M1: nothing (stock servers send 25).
- M2: player-object mask emission > 42 blocks (usually capped server-side), quest slot storage as
  uint16 (e.g., `characters.quest_slots` layout), remove-quest opcode accepts wider slots.
- M3: new opcode handlers, slot→questId mapping, chunked sync on login, remove by questId; the
  "quest log full" check (`SMSG_QUEST_LOG_FULL` = `0x195`, client just displays
  `ERR_QUEST_LOG_FULL` at `Player_C.cpp:3777-3779`) moves to the new limit.

### Quest log tests / definition of done

- M1: accept 28 quests from a stock/modded server; all existing quest UI functions at slots 25-28;
  abandon from slot 27; watch/POI on new slots.
- M2: 300-1000 quests across relog (sync correctness), abandon/accept while at the cap, mask
  boundary dwords (slot 25, 32, 128, 256…), daily count > 25, quest giver with 40 quests.
- M3: 3000+ quests; login sync time; memory; search/sort responsiveness; watch limit; POI icon
  budget; all of the above.

**Effort: M1 2-3 days · M2 ~1-2 weeks client + server · M3 3-6 weeks client + server + UI.**
**Risk: high — this is the only workstream with new protocol surface.**

## 5. Cross-cutting: protocol versioning

- Any extended build must be detectable by the server. Simplest: version field in the auth
  handshake (or a `CMSG_EXTENDED_LIMITS_HELLO {u32 limitsBitmask, u32 containerSlots, u32
  questSlots}` custom opcode) sent after login; server refuses or degrades gracefully.
- Never ship a client that emits >42-block masks to a stock server, or uint8 slot ops against a
  widened server — both fail mid-session with confusing desyncs.
- Feature flags: `EXTENDED_CONTAINERS` (B), `EXTENDED_QUEST_LOG` (M2/M3), class work needs no
  flag.

## 6. Risk register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Descriptor/index-map hand edits drift | corrupted field offsets, subtle UI bugs | generator I-1; asserts comparing `TotalFields()` against expanded table sizes at startup |
| Mask widening desyncs (M2) | dropped updates, ghost state | server-side sparse masks + fuzz test mask patterns against client parser |
| Quest log UI at thousands | unplayable frame rate | virtualized Lua list; cap visible rows |
| Container handler spam | frame hitches with many big bags | coalesce per-slot handlers (B-3) |
| Win32 fidelity checks fail on extended build | CI noise | build matrix: stock config always; extended config skips `verify.py` comparisons for touched functions |
| Server/client slot width mismatch (bags >255, quests M2) | item loss / quest loss on edge slots | stay ≤254 slots; server rejects out-of-range; extensive boundary tests |

## 7. Recommended sequence & effort summary

| Order | Workstream | Effort | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hardening PR (independent of uncaps): OOB fixes C-1, clamp quest-giver/gossip parse loops, container numSlots clamp | 0.5-1 day | safer stock client |
| 2 | I-1 descriptor generator | 2-4 days | foundation |
| 3 | Classes to 32 | 1 day code + data | new classes playable |
| 4 | Bags to 128 | 4-9 days incl. UI/tests | 128-slot bags |
| 5 | Quest M1 (28) | 2-3 days | proves machinery |
| 6 | Quest M2 (~1390) | 1-2 weeks + server | "hundreds active" |
| 7 | Quest M3 (thousands) | 3-6 weeks + server + UI | the original ask |

## Appendix B — Numbers cheat sheet

```
Player object (active)     1326 dwords used / 1344 addressable (42 masks)
Quest slot                 5 dwords (20 bytes); stock 25 slots (dwords 10..134)
Daily slot                 1 dword;      stock 25 slots (dwords 1132..1156)
Container                 66 + 2N dwords; stock N=36 → 138
Player headroom            18 dwords ≈ 3 quest slots OR 9 GUID slots
Mask byte ceiling          255 masks → 8160 dwords → ~1390 quest slots max
Container ceiling          min( (1326−66)/2 , (1344−66)/2+… ) → 630 slots safe
Slot wire width            uint8 (CMSG_SWAP/SPLIT/AUTOSTORE/…), 255 = sentinel
